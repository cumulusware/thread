* **Project:** Thread
* **Purpose:** Fabric based management of Mac OS X local client and Ubuntu servers
* **Author:** Matthew Rankin

## Purpose ##

The goal is to create a quick, repeatable, automated process to manage both my local Mac OS X client used for development and various Ubuntu servers. The Ubuntu servers that need to be managed are both running on [Slicehost][] and local hardware. Thread uses the [Fabric][] Python "library and command-line tool designed to streamline deploying applications or performing system administration tasks via SSH."
